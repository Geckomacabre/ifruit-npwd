--- GetGroundZFor_3dCoord's own docs say it only resolves "when the
--- coordinates are within the client's render distance" -- and
--- RequestCollisionAtCoord alone does not put a genuinely distant point (the
--- entire reason a map picker exists) inside that, which is why this failed
--- on almost every tap rather than just the far ones: most of a full map is
--- outside render distance from wherever the player is actually standing.
---
--- SetFocusPosAndVel is the actual fix, not RequestCollisionAtCoord: it
--- overrides where the game renders and streams terrain to an arbitrary
--- point without moving the player or camera there -- the trick teleport and
--- spawn-selector menus use to check a destination before sending anyone to
--- it. ClearFocus hands the override back once this is done with it.
