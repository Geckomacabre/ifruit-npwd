-- um_gigs -- phone gig work
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Two SEPARATE phone apps, deliberately. Nobody has one app that does food and
-- rides, and a single "work" app would read as a game menu rather than a phone.
-- They share this resource because the underlying job loop is the same; they do
-- not share an icon, a name or a screen.
--
--   Snarf    -- food delivery. Collect from a restaurant, drive to an address.
--              Still a BOARD: a courier picks a run off a list, which is what
--              the real thing looks like.
--   Ryde Me  -- rideshare. Dispatch-only. There is no list of fares sitting
--              there waiting; a request arrives, a clock starts, you take it or
--              it goes to somebody else. Plus a rider side, so a fare can be
--              another player rather than a spawned ped.
--              (internal identifier stays 'goober' throughout the code --
--              renaming that would mean touching every job.app check and the
--              player metadata key for no player-visible benefit.)
--
-- Both are parodies, and the satire is GTA's own target: not the logos, the
-- BUSINESS. Snarf calls you a Partner, rates you out of five, and keeps most
-- of the money. Ryde Me borrows the neon-pink rideshare parody that already
-- exists in-universe rather than inventing a third one.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
-- Everything else on this server requires you to drive to a fixed place to find
-- out whether there is work. This is work that arrives on your phone, which is
-- the thing a solo player actually wants: something to do, offered, wherever
-- they happen to be.

-- Two lengths, priced as two products, the way a rideshare actually is: a hop

-- not sit in the same price band. The bands OVERLAP on purpose -- a long fare
-- can pay less than a good short one, so "hold out for a long one" is not
-- automatically the right play.
--
-- Calibrated against the rest of the server: um_truckerjob pays ~100-120 a drop
-- before a 15% tax, um_taxijob runs 125 a mile (~78/km). Gig work sits at or
-- under that, because it is meant to read as the bottom of the ladder.
--
-- NOTE: distance here is straight-line between the two points, not road length.
-- Real driving is usually 30-40% further, so the effective rate per kilometre
-- actually driven is lower than these numbers suggest.
